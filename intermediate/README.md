# Intermediate Bash Scripts

This directory contains intermediate-level bash scripts that demonstrate a 
deeper understanding of shell scripting, including user interaction, data 
processing, and system monitoring.

## Scripts Overview

### System Health Check Script (`system_health.sh`)

- **Purpose**: This script provides an overview of the system's health by 
displaying disk usage, memory usage, and CPU load. It's a handy tool for 
quick system diagnostics.
- **Usage**: Run the script with `./system_health.sh`. It requires no 
additional arguments.
- **Note**: Some commands in this script are specific to Linux 
environments and may not work on macOS or other Unix-like systems.

### User Input Script (`user_input.sh`)

- **Purpose**: This script interacts with the user by asking for their 
name and age, and then calculates and displays their approximate year of 
birth. It showcases handling user input and performing arithmetic 
operations.
- **Usage**: Execute the script with `./user_input.sh` and follow the 
on-screen prompts to input your name and age.

## Learning Points

- Working with `read` to capture user input.
- Using arithmetic operations to calculate values.
- Enhanced script personalization and interaction.
- System-level monitoring and reporting commands.

## Reflection

These scripts represent a step forward in complexity, focusing more on 
user interaction and system data extraction. They were crucial in 
understanding how bash scripts can be used for practical system monitoring 
and personalized user interactions.
